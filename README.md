# orphanet-parser

Pythonic interface to key data from Orphanet. Data was obtained from the [Orphadata](https://github.com/Orphanet/Orphadata_aggregated/tree/master) GitHub repository. The goal of the Python interface is to provide access to pandas data frames, without having to parse XML files. 

The package only supports English-language data, and currently does not provide access to ontologies or disease linearization data.
